 <p>Shown below are the  Online Access Student Information System Terms and Conditions.</p>

		  <p>&nbsp;</p>

		  <p><h1>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h1><br />
		    Online Access Student Information System (OASIS) is intended for the  parents and guardians of SLU Students.  By accessing and using the OASIS system, you  accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (referred to as this  Agreement henceforth). </p>
		  <p>This Agreement sets out the legally binding terms  of one's use of the OASIS website whether one is a visitor (non-registered viewer)  or a user (registered parent or guardian).   One is only authorized to use the OASIS' services (regardless of whether  the access or use is intended) if one agrees to abide by all applicable laws  and the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp; If one does not agree to be bound by  this Agreement and to follow all applicable laws, one should leave the OASIS  website and discontinue use of the OASIS services immediately.</p>
		  <p>OASIS may modify this  Agreement from time to time and such modification shall be effective upon posting  by OASIS Admin on the OASIS Website. &nbsp;One's continued use of the OASIS’  Services after OASIS posts a revised Agreement signifies one’s acceptance of  the revised Agreement.&nbsp; It is therefore important for one to review this  Agreement regularly to ensure one is updated as to any changes. </p>

		  <p>OASIS is operated by the OASIS Website Staff of Saint Louis University.  The services of OASIS are offered to parents  and guardians who wish to monitor their ward's academic performance.  It is also available for students who would  like to monitor their own performance.   In order to monitor or “follow” your ward’s academic performance, you  must have a Student Verification Code sent by the OASIS Website Staff of Saint Louis University.<br />
		    <br />
		    SERVICES OFFERED<br />
		    OASIS’ services are for registered parents or  guardians, also known as users or followers.   A visitor can only view the main page of the website. <br />
		    <br />
		    Through OASIS, a parent or guardian can monitor a  ward’s (academic) information online.  </p>
		  <p>A follower:</p>

		  <ul>
		    <li>can view a Ward’s profile, grades, checklist, and  schedule; </li>
		    <li>will be notified of dropped class cards, shifting,  checklist updates, grade updates, and violations; and </li>
		    <li>can monitor a ward’s accounting fees, breakdown of  fees and payments.</li>
	      </ul>
		  <p>The above information is taken from the office of  Management Information Systems. <br />
		    <br />

		    A follower agrees that the provided information is  displayed in the user’s pages is for viewing purposes only.  OASIS does not accept any liability to  any person for the direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential  damages that result from the use or misuse of these provided information. </p>
		  <p>If the information on the Saint Louis University’s  official printed documents differs from the information contained on the OASIS,  the information on the University’s official printed documents will take  precedence. </p>
		  <p>REGISTRATION   <br />
		    A ward is required for one to successfully register  a user.  To monitor a ward, a parent or  guardian must know their ward’s Student Verification Code (SVC).  SVCs are generated by OASIS for every  enrolled student who does not have any followers yet. The only way to obtain an  SVC is through the Verification SMS Message (VSM).  The VSM is an invitation to parents or  guardians for OASIS registration.  A VSM  contains the ward’s information (name, ID number and SVC), registration  instructions and registration period.   VSMs are sent to the parent or guardian’s mobile number or requested  directly from the OASIS Office in case of lost SVC.<br />
		    <br />
		    For parents or guardians of SLU students who did not  receive a VSM or their VSM’s content has incomplete information, they may  contact the MIS Office.  A user can have more than one ward.   Therefore the number of VSM sent to the mobile number depends upon the  number of newly activated wards with that same mobile number. </p>

		  <p>The OASIS Website Staff and SLU do not require  parents and guardians of SLU Students to register in the OASIS.  The OASIS Verification SMS Message is merely  an invitation. </p>
		  <p>Security of the VSM’s content will no longer be the  responsibility of the OASIS Admin after it has been sent to the parent or  guardian’s mobile number.</p>
		  <p>A ward can have more than one follower; therefore,  a parent or guardian is responsible for any registration using the ward’s  SVC.  The OASIS Administrator or General  Administrator can block a user with/without a user’s prior knowledge or  consent. </p>
		  <p>OASIS registration is open online 24/7, except  during maintenance and upgrade schedules.  </p>
		  <p>LINKS<br />
		    OASIS contains hyperlinks to SLU-related sites such as  the SLU Official Website, MySLU Portal and SLU Intramurals Site only.  Use of the hyperlinks and access to such  linked websites are entirely the user's voluntary choice and responsibility.  When the user clicks on these hyperlinks to SLU-related sites, it is understood  that the user has left OASIS and is now subject to the Terms &amp; Conditions  and Privacy Policy of the new site and the information collected or used on  these sites. </p>

		  <p>Other  websites may link to OASIS with prior acknowledgment and approval from the  OASIS Administrator and SLU. The OASIS Website Staff and SLU must be explicitly  identified and duly credited as the source of information displayed.  Furthermore, the contents of the website must  be presented in the host site without any alterations. </p>
		  <p>SECURITY<br />
		    If one uses this system, one should understand  that all activities may be monitored and recorded.  Anyone using this system expressly consents  to such monitoring.  This serves as a  WARNING that if such monitoring reveals possible evidence or information of  criminal or suspicious activity, monitoring records may be provided to law  enforcement officials without any prior oral or written notice to the suspected  user.</p>
		  <p>LIABILITY<br />
		    Violation  of any of the terms and conditions, misuse and/or abuse of the website or any  of its contents, and/or misrepresentation in any form, may subject the user to  the corresponding administrative, civil and/or criminal liability under  applicable laws.</p>
